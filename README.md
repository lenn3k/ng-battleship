# Battleship

I created this project to freshen up my skills in angular and typescript.
The game and mechanics are based on this [datagenetics article](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.3.

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/game`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
